Measuring Meter: Modeling Poetic Rhythm as Coupled
Oscillators and Sequence Models
Avery Chen — avery.chen@alum.example.com
Abstract
Poetic meter is both formal constraint and embodied rhythm. We present a crossndisciplinary method that (1)
infers stress patterns with a sequence model, (2) maps those patterns to a simple physical system of coupled
oscillators, and (3) derives an interpretable “meter energy” that quantifies tension and release. On two
annotated corpora (Shakespeare sonnets; a mixed modern set), our BiLSTMnCRF achieves 92% F1 for stress
labeling; the oscillatory mapping correlates with expert scansion difficulty (ρ ≈ 0.61). We show applications to
meter classification, pedagogical visualization, and constraintnaware generation.
1. Introduction
Readers feel meter as expectation—beats you can march to—and deviation—surprises that make lines sing.
Literary scholars annotate stress with scansion marks; physicists describe periodic motion with oscillators. This
paper connects the two: we first infer a line’s stress pattern with a standard sequence model, then interpret the
pattern through a physical analogy that reveals where tension accumulates and dissipates. The goal is not to
reduce poetry to physics, but to borrow a language of explainable structure that students and machines can
both use.
2. Related Work
Prosody modeling spans rulenbased scansion, HMM/CRF tagging, and neural sequence models. Meanwhile,
physics metaphors for art (e.g., harmonics in music) offer conceptual tools for pedagogy. Our contribution is to
pair a competitive tagger with an explicit, lownparameter physical model that yields an interpretable score.
3. Data & Preprocessing
We compile two corpora: (i) Sonnets: 154 Shakespeare sonnets (∼2k lines) with canonical iambic annotations;
(ii) Modern: 1.2k lines from 20th/21stncentury poets with crowdnsourced scansion crossnchecked by two
annotators (κ=0.78). Tokens are syllabified (heuristics + CMUdict), lowercased, and enriched with POS and
lexical stress priors.
4. Method — 4.1 Stress Tagger
We train a BiLSTMnCRF to predict syllablenlevel stress (y_t ∈ {0,1}) given features (syllable, POS, word
shape, lexicon prior, position in foot). The model slightly outperforms an HMM baseline and matches a
transformer miniature on this scale while remaining fast and lightweight.
4. Method — 4.2 Oscillator Mapping

We model each foot as a damped harmonic oscillator with natural frequency tied to the expected metrical
pattern (e.g., iamb: unstress→stress). Let n_t be predicted stress; define displacement d_t = n_t − y*_t, where
y*_t is the ideal stress (0/1) for the target meter. Define pernline meter energy: E = Σ_t k d_t^2 + c(d_t −
d_{t−1})^2 with spring constant k and coupling term c encouraging smooth transitions. Intuitively, E rises with
substitutions (e.g., trochaic inversion), catalexis, or syncopation, and falls when the line settles into pattern.
4. Method — 4.3 Interpretability Layer
We align spikes in E with tokens to explain where and why tension appears (“spondee at black night”, “feminine
ending”). A simple rule set labels common phenomena for teaching.
5. Experiments
Stress Labeling: BiLSTMnCRF reaches 92.1 F1 (Sonnets) and 88.3 F1 (Modern), beating HMM by +6–9 F1.
Meter Classification (iambic vs trochaic vs free): logistic regression on summary features of E hits 91.5%
accuracy. Pedagogy Study (pilot): 24 students used a prototype energy overlay in a scansion exercise; quiz
scores improved by +14% vs. control, and confidence selfnreports increased.
