## About

**HackMIT 2025** is a project by the *GapLess* team aiming to create a living, verifiable skills profile that turns your real work (docs, links, repos) into a structured, evidence-backed portfolio, maps you to non-obvious roles, and generates tailored “apply” packets in one click.

We built both a **frontend** and **backend** to [describe what user sees / what backend handles].

## Features

- Feature 1 — e.g. User authentication / login  
- Feature 2 — e.g. Real-time data updates  
- Feature 3 — e.g. Interactive UI with X / Y  
- Feature 4 — e.g. Database with persistence  
- … *(add what else you’ve done / plan to do)*
